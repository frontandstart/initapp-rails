# Ruby on rails starter pack with docker

Hello, this is a boilerplate Ruby on Rails application with docker compose setup for development that I used for starting. Most of the time it was outdated from a setup that I used in real projects, decided to keep it up-to-date and open source.

Goals
- [x] Easy up and run rails application using docker compose
- [ ] Js/css with jsbundling and cssbundling
- [ ] CI/CD
    - [ ] Github actions
- [ ] Provide different options for managing infrastructure and deploying to staging/production environment
    - [ ] Kubernetes deployment using Terraform to Digitalocean
    - [ ] Kubernetes deployment using Terraform to AWS
    - [ ] Kubernetes deployment using Terraform to GCP
    - [ ] Kubernetes deployment using Terraform to Azure
    - [ ] Heroku deployment
    - [ ] VPS/EC2 deployment using Docker swarm reproxy
